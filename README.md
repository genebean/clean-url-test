# clean-url-test
A quick test to show how to make urls cleaner using profile pages as an example.

To use this:

1. clone it and cd into the directory
2. run `vagrant up`
3. open a browser and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
4. play around

If you make changes you will need to either manually sync files OR run
`vagrant reload --provision` from your computer.
